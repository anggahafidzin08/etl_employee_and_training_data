### **Task 2**: ETL, Data Warehouse and Analytics Task
For this task, I have to create a data pipeline that will extract and transform a table data from Azure SQL Server and  another one from GCP (in this case using Google Spreadsheet as data platform). The data extracted from 2 different sources will be used on Looker Studio as an [Employee Monitoring Dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/da25f3a4-d158-409d-a357-c26df808a839).

In this project I used Kaggle public datasets:
- [Employee Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravindrasinghrana/employeedataset?resource=download&select=employee_data.csv)
- [Training & Development](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravindrasinghrana/employeedataset?resource=download&select=training_and_development_data.csv)
